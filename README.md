# Physics Projects

Recently I realized that trying out physics projects is a really great and gratifying way to learn programming--and a lot more simple than it seems! Here are a few of my favorite projects
from recent moments, roughly in chronological order, with potentially more to come (I'll try to keep this website and its links updated). Note: I'll also try to add images and/or video
demos for all the projects soon.
